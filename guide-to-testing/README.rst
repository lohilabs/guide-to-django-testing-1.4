==========================
Guide to Testing in Django
==========================

This is the example project demonstrating how to go about testing from the
`blog series`_ on the topic. It adds tests to the perennial "`polls`_" app
from the Django tutorial (minus the generic views).

Tags have been added for each step in the process, starting with ``01-initial``.
The project is based on Django 1.3 & SQLite.
